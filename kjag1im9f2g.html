For this reason, when investors and analysts discuss yield, they’re usually referring to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldtomaturity.asp">yield to maturity</a>&nbsp;(YTM), which is the total anticipated return if a bond is held until maturity – including any capital gains or losses due to price fluctuation.</div><div>Because calculating YTM is complicated and time consuming, investors (both private and professional) typically rely on financial calculators to do the math.
